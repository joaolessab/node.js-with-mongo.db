## NODE JS NOTES
- NodeJS is a JavaScript code interpretor;
- It was created based on [V8 JavaScript Engine](https://v8.dev/) (that was created for Google Chrome);
- NodeJS and V8 is written in C#;
- Even though NodeJS was written in C#, its function is to understand only JavaScript;
- NodeJS has the power to answer lots of protocols, for example: "HTTP" (so our application will be able to communicate using requests);
- NodeJS is bringing JavaScript to the Back End;

## CLIENT-SERVER
